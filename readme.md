This is the first stage of the calculation, and we have succeeded in expressing the determinant of the 4 × 4 matrix A in terms of the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix. The next stage involves this 3 × 3 matrix. Again, we can use any row or column for the compactor expansion. The third column is preferred (with two zeros), so
